# AOSPA Pixel Navbar Animations

A magisk module to replace the SystemUI.apk from Paranoid Android 7.3 on the OnePlus 3 with a modded version that uses the navbar animation from the Google Pixel

### WARNING

This module has been tested on the OnePlus 3 (Not the OnePlus 3T) on Paranoid Android version 7.3 ONLY. I can't guarantee any other device/version will work!
